= Git for Vlad

* http://github.com/jbarnette/vlad-git
* http://rubyhitsquad.com/Vlad_the_Deployer.html

== Description

Vlad plugin for Git support. This was previously part of Vlad, but all
modules outside the core recipe have been extracted.

== Installation

 $ gem install vlad-git

== Usage

(Adapted from Vlad's getting started guide:
http://hitsquad.rubyforge.org/vlad/doco/getting_started_txt.html)

In your Rakefile, load Vlad with the :scm => :git:

 begin
   require 'vlad'
   Vlad.load :scm => :git
 rescue LoadError
   # do nothing
 end

In config/deploy.rb, set the repository:

 set :application, "project"
 set :domain, "example.com"
 set :deploy_to, "/path/to/install"
 set :repository, 'git@example.com:project'

By default, vlad-git will deploy origin/master. To deploy an arbitrary
rev-spec, set the :revision in config/deploy.rb:

 set :revision, "origin/my_branch" # Deploy a branch
 set :revision, "v2.0"             # Deploy a tag
 set :revision, "a3539b3f3e9edba1" # Deploy a commit
